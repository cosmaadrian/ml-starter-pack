# Machine Learning Started Pack
A comprehensive repository of resources for getting started in machine learning research. Links and resources are provided for educational purposes only (literally).

Education should be free and available for anyone interested. 

Contributions are welcome, just drop a PR! 

This list is inspired by many other more comprehensive (but daunting) lists on github. This list should not be considered a "complete" list of resources, but rather a curated curriculum for going from noob to an above average deep learning researcher. Check out other works:
